# Module 1 - Beginner Lab: Where's Bitcoin?
## Background
In 2009, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group and released as open-source software capable of supporting peer-to-peer digital financial transactions without the need for a central authority. In modern times, there have been many new cryptocurrencies using the same or similar mechanisms, each with their own style and features. This lab will introduce the reader to some of the services available which will hopefully allow an unacquainted person to get a feel for where and how Bitcoin may be interacted with. Just follow the embedded links and have a look around.

## Assignment Instructions
1. Our first stop is the book this lab and many others are based on, which the reader may find useful in a quest for a deeper understanding of Bitcoin, [_Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition_][BitcoinBook]. Although a print version exists, the authors have made the entire text conveniently open-source and available on GitHub. [Here's a link to the first chapter.][BitcoinBookChapter01]
2. What if you just want to own some Bitcoin? Well, we'll save the process of setting up a wallet and funding it (most likely with test funds rather than actual Bitcoin \[have you seen the price?\]) until a later lab, but in the meantime, let's look at some of the places and ways you might obtain some Bitcoin later on:
    * For person-to-person transactions, there's [meetup.com][BitcoinMeetup].
    * If you want something a little more geared towards Bitcoin, specifically, you can try [localbitcoins.com][LocalBitcoins].
    * There are also ATMs which will convert $USD into Bitcoin for you, and there's a site to show you where they are: [coinatmradar.com][CoinATMRadar].
3. Okay, all good and well, but what if you just want to speculate on Bitcoin? Well, there are a few options for that as well (among others):
    * You can have a look at [bitcoinaverage.com][BitcoinAverage].
    * There's also [coincap.io][CoinCap].
    * Last but perhaps not least, is the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group][CMEGroup].
4. Finally, if you're really just interested in the technology behind Bitcoin, there's the public [whitepaper (academic reading)][BitcoinPaper].
5. Have a look around at all of the links and try to get a feel for Bitcoin as a currency. In future labs, we will interact with the technology behind Bitcoin.
